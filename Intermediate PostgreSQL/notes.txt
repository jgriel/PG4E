ALTERING TABLE SCHEMA
    ALTER TABLE <table_name> DROP COLUMN <col_name>;
                       ALTER COLUMN <col_name> TYPE <type>;  
                       ADD COLUMN <col_name> <type>;

    Execute Commands from .sql File: \i <file-path>

DATES
    Types:
        DATE
        TIME
        TIMESTAMP (time & date)
        TIMESTAMPTZ (w/ time zone)
        NOW() (PostgreSQL) --> DEFAULT NOW() when creating table

    Able to cast: NOW()::DATE || CAST(NOW() AS DATE), 
    Date interval arithmetic: NOW() - INTERVAL '2 days'

DISTINCT / GROUP BY
    DISTINCT - only shows unique rows once
    DISTINCT ON - limits duplicate removal to a set of columns
    GROUP BY = combined with aggregate functions COUNT(), MAX(), SUM(), AVG(), etc...

SUBQUERIES
    Query within a Query
    Don't use it too much (slow)
    SELECT <columns> FROM (<subquery) WHERE ...;

CONCURRENCY & TRANSACTIONS 
    Compound Statements - do more than one thing in one statement
        INSERT INTO <column> (headers)
            VALUES (<>)
        RETURNING *;
